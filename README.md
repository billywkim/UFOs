# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis

The goal of this analysis was to create a webpage using Java and HTML to include data about UFO sightings. Filters were added to refine the search function including date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

On the previous version of the webpage, only a Date filter was present. After working on it further, additional filters were added. Users can input the criteria they would like to find in the search filters and the data will automatically sort. Users may choose to filter their search with only 1 criteria or may choose to find more specific information by adding multiple criteria to their search.

**Search filters with no criteria**

**Search filters with multiple criteria**

## Summary

One major drawback of this analysis is that the webpage has not been coded correctly to fit into tablets. Therefore, I would recommend to further develop the code to readjust the sizes and margins of the webpage so it is tablet/mobile friendly.

Another drawback of this webpage is that the search filters are not intuitive. The search crtieria must be typed exactly as it appears in the dataset. An improvement in the search filter logic is recommended for it to be more user-friendly.
